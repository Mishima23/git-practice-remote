You sure you want to be with me
I've nothing to give
Won't lie and say this lovin's best
Well leave us in emotional pace
Take a walk, taste the rest
No, take a rest

[3D]

I see you digging a hole in your neighborhood
You're crazy but you're lazy
I need to live and I need to
Your troubles must be seen to see through
Money like it's paper with faces i remember
I drink on a daily basis
Though it subtle cools my temper
It never cools my temper

[Tricky]

Walking through the suburbs though not exactly lovers
You're a couple, 'specially when your body's doubled
Duplicate, then you wait for the next kuwait

[Tricky & 3D]
